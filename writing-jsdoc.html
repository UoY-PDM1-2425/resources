        <h1>Writing JSDoc</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>You should document every function you write (except p5.js functions like <code>draw()</code>) using JSDoc.
        </p>

            <h2>Writing JSDoc in VS Code</h2>
            <p>VS Code has built-in support that makes writing JSDoc a little easier. Start by writing your function. Then,
                on the line <em>above</em> the function definition, type /** and press Enter / Return. VS Code will automatically 
                generate a JSDoc template tailored to your function. The video below shows how this works.
            </p>
            <p>

                    <source src="./images/jsdoc.mov" type="video/mp4">
                    Your browser does not support the video tag.
                </video>
            </p>
            <p>Write a description of the function on the first line of the generated template. The description should focus on the <em>purpose</em> of the function. 
            You don't need to describe how it's implemented unless it's required in order to understand the function's 
            purpose.</p>
            <p>VS Code should have generated a template for each parameter (if there are any). The template will look like this:</p>
            <pre>@param {*} paramName</pre>
            <p>The asterisk, *, is a placeholder for the expected data type. The data types you're most likely to use are <code>number</code>, 
            <code>boolean</code>, and <code>string</code>. To represent an array (covered in Week 5), use the name of the data type stored in the array 
            followed by square brackets e.g.:</p>
            <pre>@param {number[]} xVals</pre>
            <p>See the <a href="https://jsdoc.app/tags-param.html" target="_blank">JSDoc reference</a> for more complex examples.</p>
            <p>As well as specifying the type of your parameters, it's a good idea to add a brief description after the name that explain the 
                meaning of the parameter. A well-named parameter might not need explaining but, if there's any ambiguity, add a description.
            </p>
            <p>If your function has a return statement, VS Code will automatically add the JSDoc keyword <code>@returns</code>. Add the return data type 
            in curly braces and a description, if required. E.g.:</p>
            <pre>@returns {string} Description goes here</pre>
            <p>There are more examples in the <a href="https://jsdoc.app/tags-returns.html" target="_blank">JSDoc reference</a> on the @returns tag.</p>
            <p>The tags shown above (<code>@param</code> and <code>@returns</code>) are the most common but JSDoc supports many more. Take a look at <a href="https://jsdoc.app/" 
            target="_blank">the full list</a>.</p>

            <h2>Reasons To Use JSDoc</h2>
            <h3>(...aside from the fact that it's required in the assessment for this module!)</h3>
            <p>Complete documentation makes your code much easier to understand by other programmers. It is typically 
                required if you are programming in a professional setting.
            </p>
            <p>Writing documentation also has the immediate benefit of improving VS Code's code completion and hinting while 
                your're working on sketches. When you use p5.js functions in your sketches, you may have noticed that VS Code 
                provides hints that describe the function and show the expected parameters. These hints appear because the 
                p5.js source code is fully documented using JSDoc. Below is a screenshot showing what happens when you call the 
                <code>circle()</code> function. Note that the popover describes the function, shows the parameters, and even 
                highlights which parameter you should provide an argument for next.
            </p>

            <p>You can see the source of this documentation in the <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/main/src/core/shape/2d_primitives.js" target="_blank">p5.js source code</a> on GitHub. The <code>circle()</code> documentation 
            starts on line 274.</p>
