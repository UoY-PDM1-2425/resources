            <ol>
                <li>Go to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">github.com</a>.</li>
                <li>Click the "Sign Up" button.</li>
                <li>You will be prompted to enter an email address. You can use any email address you like and you can also
                    associate your account with multiple email addresses. If you choose to sign up with a personal email address, we
                    will ask you to link your York email address so that we can easily give you access to course GitHub resources. If
                    you choose to sign up with your York email, we recommend that you also link a personal email address so you don't
                    lose access to your code when you graduate. The instructions for linking additional emails are <a href="#existing">in the next section</a>.</li>
                <li>Follow the rest of the steps in GitHub's account creation process. You will be asked to create a username during sign 
                    up. This username will be public so choose something that you're happy for future employers to see!

            <h2>I already have a GitHub account / I need to link an email address to my GitHub account</h2>
            <p>If you already have a GitHub account associated with an email address other than your University of 
                York email, you will need to link your uni email so that you can be added to course repos.If you 
                just created a new account with your uni email, it's a good idea to link a personal email 
                address as well. When you have multiple emails associated with your account, you can choose which 
                one receives notifications from GitHub.
