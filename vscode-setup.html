        <h1>Visual Studio Code Setup</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>The recommended IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for this module is Visual Studio 
            Code, or VS Code for short. You may choose to use a different IDE but please be aware that 
            all module materials will be written for VS Code and module staff may not be able to help 
            you troubleshoot your IDE if you use something else.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>If you are using a lab computer, VS Code should already be installed. Find it in Applications 
                and open it. If you are working on your own computer, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">download VS Code</a>, install it, then open it.</li>
            <li>VS Code allows you to extend its built in capabilities by installing extensions. In this 
                module, we will use an extension called Live Preview. Open the Extensions pane from the left 
                menu (the icons). The Extensions icon looks like this:<br/><img src="./images/extensions.png" alt="The extensions icon in VS Code"></li>
            <li>In the Extensions pane, scroll through the list of installed extensions to see if Live Preview is present. If it is, move on to optional steps below. If it is not installed, use the search bar to search for Live Preview. There are a number of extensions with very similar names. Select the extension created by Microsoft, then click Install.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Optional but recommended settings for Live Preview</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Click on the Settings icon in the left menu of VS Code and select Settings from the pop up menu.</li>
            <li>In the search bar in the Settings pane, search for "Live Preview". You will see a list of settings for the Live Preview extension. Scroll down the list and look for a setting called "Live Preview: Open Preview Target". Make sure this option is set to "External Browser" rather than the default, "Embedded Preview".</li>
            <li>Still in the Settings pane, scroll up through the list of settings and look for "Live Preview: Custom External Browser". Choose a browser. Chrome is recommended but Firefox will also work. It should be a browser that allows you to see its JavaScript console. If in doubt, ask an instructor or GTA.</li>
